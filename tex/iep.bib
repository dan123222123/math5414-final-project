  abstract = {Matrices where all minors are nonnegative are said to be totally nonnegative (TN) matrices. In the case of banded TN matrices, which can be expressed by products of several bidiagonal TN matrices, Fukuda et al. (Annal. Mat. Pura Appl. 192, 423\textendash 445, 2013) discussed the eigenvalue problem from the viewpoint of the discrete hungry Toda (dhToda) equation. The dhToda equation is a discrete integrable system associated with box and ball systems. In this paper, we consider an inverse eigenvalue problem for such banded TN matrices by examining the properties of the dhToda equation. This problem is a real-valued nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. First, we show the determinant solution to the dhToda equation with suitable boundary conditions. Next, we clarify the relationship between the characteristic polynomials of the banded TN matrices and the determinant solution. Finally, taking this relationship into account, we design a finite-step procedure for constructing banded TN matrices with specified eigenvalues. We also present an example to demonstrate this procedure.},

  abstract = {Existing methods to find the eigenvalue spectrum (or a reasonable approximation to it) of square matrices can be extended to Stochastic Matrices (SM). The matter is more delicate for the Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (IEP), which consists in the reconstruction of a matrix from a given eigenvalue spectrum. In this work, we present a simple method to solve a real-valued IEP for SM by constructing step-by-step the solution matrix through an elementary Markov state disaggregation method named state splitting, and based on a matrix operator. After showing some results on how the splitting operator influences the steady-state distribution of the Markov chain associated with the SM, we demonstrate that the state splitting operator has a fundamental property: when applied to a SM A of size n-by-n, it yields a SM of size (n+1)-by-(n+1), whose eigenvalue spectrum is equal to that of A, plus an additional eigenvalue belonging to a bounded interval. We use a constructive method to prove that for any spectrum made of real and positive eigenvalues, one can build up an infinite number of SM sharing this spectrum. Finally, we present a new sufficient condition to test if a given set of real values can be the spectrum of a SM constructed by the proposed method.},

First we derive the equations of motion, then compare the eigenvalues of the resulting linearized model against vibration data measured from our laboratory's monochord. More challenging is the recovery of masses and positions of the beads from spectral data, a problem for which a variety of elegant algorithms exist. After presenting one such method based on orthogonal polynomials in a manner suitable for advanced undergraduates, we confirm its efficacy through physical experiment.

We next clarify the asymptotic behavior of the discrete hungry Toda (dhToda) equation, which is also an integrable system, and show that a similarity transformation for a TN matrix is given through the dhToda equation.

The solution uses Markov state disaggregation to construct a Markov chain with the associated stochastic transition matrix possessing the required eigenspectrum. Existing solutions that follow the same approach are limited to constructing matrices with real-valued eigenspectra. The novel solution directly constructs matrices with complex-valued eigenspectra by applying a new disaggregation technique in tandem with a technique from a previous solution. Due to this generalization, the novel solution is able to successfully model physical systems from a larger family. Furthermore, the novel solution constructs the matrix in a finite and predetermined number of iterations, and without numerical approximation. The solution is demonstrated by deriving an expression for a set of 4\texttimes 4 stochastic matrices sharing the same prescribed complex-valued eigenspectrum and indexed by a real parameter.},

Unlike well-established coupling-matrix models based on frequency-invariant couplings or linear frequency-variant couplings (LFVCs), a model with arbitrary reactive frequency-variant coupling (AFVC) networks is proposed. The engineered formulation is more general than prior-art ones\textemdash with the only restriction that the coupling network is a reactive-type two-port circuit\textemdash and can be treated as an extension of previous synthesis models since constant or linear couplings are special cases of arbitrary frequency dependence. The suggested model is fully general, which allows for AFVCs with highly nonlinear (even singular) characteristics, loaded or unloaded nonresonating nodes (NRNs), frequency-dependent source\textendash load coupling, multiple frequency-variant cross couplings, and/or multiple dispersive couplings for connecting the source and load to the filter network. The model is accompanied by a powerful synthesis technique that is based on the zeros and poles of the admittance or scattering parameters and the eigenvalues of properly defined eigenproblems. In the most general case, the zeros and poles of the admittance or scattering parameters are related to solutions of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. The synthesis is defined as an inverse nonlinear eigenvalue problem (INEVP) where the matrix is constructed from three sets of eigenvalues. This is accomplished by optimization using an iterative nonlinear least-squares solver with excellent convergence property. Finally, the third- and fifth-order examples of bandpass filter topologies involving AFVCs are shown, and the experimental validation of the proposed theory is presented through the manufacturing and characterization of a microstrip filter prototype with transmission zeros (TZs).},

  abstract = {We give the formulation of a Riemannian Newton algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear eigenvalue problems by minimizing a total energy  function subject to the orthogonality constraint. Under some mild assumptions, we establish the global and quadratic convergence of the proposed method. Moreover, the positive definiteness condition of the Riemannian Hessian of the total energy  function at a solution is derived. Some numerical tests are reported to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method for solving large-scale problems.},

  abstract = {The following problem is considered: -u{${''}$}+f(u)={$\lambda$}u,x{$\in$}(0,1),u=u(x),u(0)=1,u{${'}$}(0)=u(1)=0, where {$\lambda$} is a spectral parameter. The inverse problem is studied: a subsequence {$\lambda$}n\textrightarrow +{$\infty$} of the sequence of eigenvalues is given and odd f is the unknown quantity. A description of the whole class of solutions of this problem is obtained. In addition, it is proved that there exists at most one function f such that an auxiliary function is nondecreasing.},
